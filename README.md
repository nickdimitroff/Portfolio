## Tropo

You likely don't care about the exact temperature outside, just that it's not wildly different than yesterday. Why mess with degrees and trends when all you want to know is how comfortable it will be?

Tropo queries a weather API using your IP address and returns what _adorable emoji animal_ would be most comfortable outside right now.

## Blank

It's become cliche now that the first app you build will be a to-do list. I've taken that idea and turned it on its head. 

A normal to-do app tracks what you tell it. But what if it told _you_ what to do? What if it reminded you of things you forgot to even jot down?
